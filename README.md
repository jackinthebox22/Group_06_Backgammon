# Backgammon Rules

## Objective:
The objective of Backgammon is to move all your checkers around the board and bear them off before your opponent does.

## Board:
- Backgammon is played on a board divided into four quadrants, each with six points. The points are numbered from 1 to 24.
- Each player has 15 checkers of their color.

## Setup:
- Each player starts with their checkers on specific points: two on their 24-point, five on their 13-point, three on their 8-point, and five on their 6-point. Our Code does this for you :D
- Players roll one die each to determine who goes first, with the higher roller starting.

## Movement:
- Players move their checkers based on the roll of two six-sided dice.
- A player can move a checker the number of points equal to the pips on one die, or split the movement between two checkers.
- Movement can only occur to an open point or to a point occupied by their own checkers.
- Players may not move to a point occupied by two or more of their opponent's checkers.

## Hitting and Entering:
- If a player lands on a point occupied by a single opponent checker, the opponent's checker is hit and placed on the bar.
- A player must then re-enter their hit checkers into the opposing home board before making any other moves.
- A player cannot move any other checkers until all their hit checkers are back in play.

## Bearing Off:
- Once a player has moved all their checkers into their home board, they can start bearing off.
- To bear off, a player must roll a number equal to the point where the checker is located.
- If a player rolls a number higher than the highest point with a checker, they can bear off a checker from the highest occupied point.
- The first player to bear off all their checkers wins the game.

## Doubling Cube (Optional):
- Players can use a doubling cube to increase the stakes of the game. If a player thinks they have an advantage, they can offer to double the current stakes.
- The opponent can either accept the double and continue the game at double the current stakes or decline and forfeit the current game.
